FOOD CUISINE PREDICTION
ZACHARY KNEPP

# DESCRIPTION
THIS PROGRAM TAKES THE YUMMLY.JSON DATASET AND TRAINS A MULTICLASS CLASSIFIER TO PREDICT THE CUISINE TYPE BASED ON USER INPUT OF INGREDIENTS, AND WILL PROVIDE THE USER WITH RECIPES THAT CONTAIN SIMILAR INGREDIENTS. THE USER WILL PROVIDE THE PROGRAM WITH THE NUMBER OF SIMILAR RECIPES DESIRED, AND A LIST OF INGREDIENTS. THE PROGRAM WILL TAKE THE LIST OF INGREDIENTS, AND CLASSIFY THE INGREDIENTS WITH A RANDOM FOREST ALGORITHM. THE PREDICTED CLASSIFICATION IS THEN USED TO SUBSET A DATAFRAME THAT CONTAINS LIKE CUISINES. COSINE SIMILARITY IS CALCULATED ACROSS THE DATAFRAME WITH THE USER PROVIDED INGREDIENTS, AND THE TOP N CUISINES WITH THE HIGHEST COSINE SIMILARITY ARE SELECTED. RESULTS ARE THEN PRINTED OUT.

# FUNCTIONS

pull_keys(list_of_dictionaries):
PULLS CUISINES AND INGREDIENTS FROM A LIST OF DICTIONARIES AND STORES THE DATA IN LISTS

pull_key(d):
PULLS CUISINES AND INGREDIENTS FROM A SINGLE DICTIONARY

make_model():
MAKES TFIDFVECTORIZER TO TRANSFORM THE DATA. MAKES A RANDOM FOREST MODEL WITH 100 TREES. RETURNS THE VECTORIZER AND THE RANDOM FOREST MODEL.

make_df():
CREATES A DATAFRAME FROM THE YUMMLY.JSON FILE THAT CONSISTS OF CUISINES, ID, AND INGREDIENTS. RETURNS DATAFRAME

dict_to_vect(d, tv):
TRANSFORMS DICTIONARY TO VECTOR USING THE TFIDFVECTORIZER FROM EARLIER

homemade_cosine_similarity(a,b):
SKLEARN COSINE_SIMILARITY() FUNCTION WAS GICING ME TROUBLE SO I JUST MADE MY OWN COSINE SIMILARITY.

print_results(df, pred, list_of_ingredients, N, score):
TAKES ALL PREDICTED AND STRUCTURED DATA. COMPUTES SIMILARITY SCORES AND PRINTS OUT THE TOP N RECIPES.

# BUGS AND ASSUMPTIONS
THE BIGGEST PROBLEM I RAN INTO WAS SENDING THE MODEL TO GITHUB. IT SAID MY MODEL WAS TOO BIG. TO WORK AROUND THIS, I WROTE THE PROGRAM TO MAKE THE MODEL WHEN FIRST EXECUTED, WHICH TAKES ABOUT 20 MINUTES. THE PROGRAM WILL SAVE THE MODEL LOCALLY, AND CALL ON THE SAVED MODEL FOR THE REST OF THE EXECUTIONS, TAKING LESS THAN 5 SECONDS.

ASSUMPTIONS MADE:
THE USER WILL HAVE THE RAM AVAILABLE TO MAKE THE MODEL.
THE USER WILL HAVE NO INPUT ERRORS.

BUGS:
IF THE USER DOES NOT HAVE ENOUGH RAM TO BUILD THE MODEL, THE PROGRAM WILL CRASH.
